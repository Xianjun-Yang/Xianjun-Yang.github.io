I am a third-year cs PhD student researching ML/NLP/GenAI/AI4Science at University of California, Santa Barbara, co-advised by Professor [Linda Petzold](https://engineering.ucsb.edu/people/linda-petzold), [William Yang Wang](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/), and [Stephen Wilson](https://materials.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/stephen-wilson). I am affiliated with [UCSB NLP group](http://nlp.cs.ucsb.edu/) and [UCSB Quantum Foundry](https://quantumfoundry.ucsb.edu/). Prior to cs, I was a phd on Fluid Mechanics at ME department of UCSB. I received my B.S. from Energy and Power Engineering from Tsinghua University.
